			<p>6/5/2022 – <strong>What Projects to work on?</strong></p>

			<p>This is where the rubber meets the road.  I really want to finish my projects and not go from idea to idea starting new projects.  In addition to the projects I’ve listed in <a href="#P1">New Start</a> below I have started many others and worked on many things.</p>

			<p>And now I’ve started working on this website and I’ve also been actively learning FPGA programming and electronics off and on for about the past 3½ years.  I’ll go for a few weeks and then I’ll put it aside for months.  Then life happens.  Then I’ll pick it up again and I have to re-learn what I already learned.  In the process I have learned quite a bit of stuff, but have much to learn yet.  I want to keep learning and experimenting and writing about it.</p>

			<p>There are two main categories of projects:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Long term projects that don’t necessarily have an end that are rather large, with no timescale for completion and not well defined where the goal is open-ended.</li>
				<li>Short term projects with a definite goal and an end in site where one can say it’s complete.  At least a given version or release of it.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>My long term projects are currently these:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The CoCo3.org website</li>
				<li>Learning FPGA programming</li>
				<li>Learning electronics</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Others that are fair game are learning math and chess!! :)</p>

			<p>I already know how to program software and even though it too is a continuous learning process I will not be blogging about it or doing tutorials such as C# or Python programming.  There are already many sites that do that.</p>

			<p>I will attempt to constrain myself to work on 3 short term projects at a time – to start:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Retro.NET</li>
				<li>MC6x09 C# emulator</li>
				<li>eStudio</li>
			</ul>

			<p>5/30/2022 – <strong>New Start</strong></p>

			<p>I have a bad habit of starting hobby projects and then not finishing them.  Starting a new project and playing w/ the new ideas is fun.  But it does not take long for it to start feeling like real work.  And that is the problem.  That is when I get bored w/ it and move on to something else. </p>

			<p>Hopefully this is a new start w/ a new determination that I do not move on to other projects until I have at least a usable version of the project I am working on.  With the caveat that I will allow myself to work on 2 or 3 projects at the same time. But NO more!</p>

			<p>Back in 2020 I collected all my hobby projects and placed them on GitHub.  All of them were unfinished and not usable.  I since decided to make them all private until I can get to each one and finish them at least to a point where they are usable / useful.</p>

			<p>Here is that list of unfinished projects, in no particular order:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>RetroDb</strong> – A Database of all things related to Retro Computing.</li>
				<li><strong>Retro.NET</strong> – A Common Intermediate Language (CIL) Ahead of Time (AoT) compiler for 8bit and 16bit retro systems.</li>
				<li><strong>CoCo#</strong> – A C# compiler at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level for the Color Computer (and possibly others)</li>
				<li><strong>Retro.BASIC</strong> – A BASIC compiler for various flavors of old-school BASIC primarily Disk Extended Color BASIC (DECB).</li>
				<li><strong>Retro.Pascal</strong> – A Pascal compiler for retro systems.</li>
				<li><strong>Retro.IDE</strong> – a Retro system IDE</li>
				<li><strong>EmuDisk</strong> – Modification and improvements to <strong><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/emudisk/">EmuDisk</a></strong></li>
				<li><strong>CoCoSamples</strong> – Source Code Samples for the Tandy / TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo 1/2, 3)!</li>
				<li><strong>eStudio</strong> – An Electronics Schematic / PCB / Simulator program.</li>
				<li><strong>GitTool</strong> – A custom tool for updating GitHub projects.</li>
				<li><strong>CCE</strong> – A C# CoCo3 emulator.</li>
				<li><strong>VCC</strong> – help improve <strong><a href="https://github.com/VCCE/VCC">VCC</a></strong> (I did one thing that got rolled in, implemented keep Aspect Ratio)</li>
				<li><strong>EMC-10</strong> – A C# MC-10 emulator.</li>
				<li><strong>SWTPC FPGA</strong> – an FPGA Emulator of the SWTPC system</li>
			</ul>
