Retro Computer Festival 2024: November 9-10, 2024
Centre for Computing History, Cambridge, England
In the early stages of planning for this year, this is (I believe) the
largest general retro computing show in the UK (it's their VCF style show),
covering all retro machines. NOTE: thanks to Randy Kindig, it is confirmed
that it is a 2 day show.

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
</strong></big>-------------------------------
1) RichN posted a video updated of his Coco 1/2 Spy Hunter game - the first
"playable" version but still buggy - to the Coco Discord:
  (show Spy Hunter.mov from my desktop)

2) CocoTown has released his next video of his series on finishing up a
Moon Patrol game that he started as a teenager. This episode he starts
getting the moon buggy moving left to right... with his traditional
"everything that happened including mistakes" mantra:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/72hi1h9eo_Q?si=WrMASv03Sb8HM0kl">https://youtu.be/72hi1h9eo_Q?si=WrMASv03Sb8HM0kl</a>

3) M.David Johnson (who will be at CocoFest!) has updated his BDS software
page with some academic papers and demo DSK images using his ML Foundation
System - a couple of game images as well as printer routines and disk
utilities. They are available on his website (along with his previous Coco
projects). The ML foundation system is for the Coco 1/2, and is meant to
run faster than regular Extended BASIC:
  <a href="https://www.bds-soft.com/cocoPapers.php">https://www.bds-soft.com/cocoPapers.php</a>

4) George Janssen has uploaded the DSK images (to the Coco Discord) and two
more episodes (Lesson 11, parts 1 and 2) of his Coco 3 assembly language
series (to YouTube). Lesson 11, Part 1 stars with drawing a rectangular
spiral in the 320x192x16 mode (the same as HSCREEN 2 in BASIC), calling
the HPRINT routine in BASIC, and then he shows you how to change the
GIME settings to uses 320x200x200 (well, 199 in reality). Part 2 adds a
BASIC program and another option for drawing, and some programming tips
on modifying code using BRN/BRA, and using indirect JMP's.
George is also wondering if many people are watching/using his lessons. Is
there certain subjects/topics for Coco 3 assembly language that viewers
would like George to cover?

5) The next TRS-80 Trash Talk podcast/live stream is on May 4 at 5 PM EDT
- during the Fest. They are asking if anyone would like to pop on during
the show to do a live update from the CocoFest show floor. If you can,
please reply to the message on the Coco Facebook group (or on the TRS-80
Discord, if you are a member there):

6) Joe Lowe on the Coco Facebook group has posted a few pictures of him
running Fujinet on his Coco 3, including mounting a 40 MB file that contains
256 floppy drive images into Drive 0:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161275727482641">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161275727482641</a>/
He also showed a photo of TELNETing at 80 columns:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161275703017641">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161275703017641</a>/
They will be demonstrating the new Coco 3 functionality at CocoFest,
too! And for those who aren't able to build their own boards, they have
parts on order for 10 units, that they are hoping to have assembled and
available by late May.

7) Speaking of Fujinet, Thomas Cherryhomes is asking for some help in
porting his 5 card stud cross-platform client program to the Coco, so that
they can join with C64, Apple II, etc. users. Details in his Facebook post,
including a link to the Github with the current clients and an example
makefile for CMOC:

8) Matthew Coffron posted photos of him upgrading his Coco 2 to 64K and
adding Extended BASIC He used a 2364-27C128 adaptor card from PCBWay with
27C64 EPROM. It even worked on his first try, and this may be an option
for those having trouble finding some of the original EPROM sizes that
the Coco 1/2 used.

9) Mark Lowe is migrated his site Coco Central to Dreamhost from Godaddy,
which he mentions is now 4x faster. Now that the migration is complete,
I look forward to him adding even more Coco content!:
  <a href="https://cococentral.com">https://cococentral.com</a>/

10) Jeffrey Duncan put up a post on the Coco Facebook group, asking if Disk
Color Scripsit was ever released (it was; I used it for a bit back in the
day until I got Telewriter-64). He may have been thinking of OS-9 Scripsit,
which did appear in a Radio Shack Catalog, but was never released. However,
since it was written by Robert Kilgus and Brian Wieseler has gotten all of
Robert's old disks, it is possible we may get to resurrect it (assuming the
disk works). It actually looked pretty advanced, including proportional
text support and full justification based on word or character, amongst
other things:

11) Julian Brown (who has been working on the replacement (and now enhanced)
Dragon 32 motherboard, has aquired, I believe, his first Coco (a middle era
Coco 2 - full travel keyboard, but the original VDG). Congrats! Hopefully
you can find a Coco 3 as well!

12) Bob Emery (La CocCo Strangiato on YouTube) released a video - "HDMI
On Board Revisited", where he uses more recent technology to get the Coco
3 RGB Analog output working with HDMI TV's/monitors, using SCART and some
custom cabling:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/MYk-C6K9roo?si=Fds4HtR2UGyN50oK">https://youtu.be/MYk-C6K9roo?si=Fds4HtR2UGyN50oK</a>

13) I was one of the guests on the International Computer Club show on
the Amigos network, going through a bit of NitrOS9/EOU version 1.0.1,
and also some preview notes on the interview with Robert Kilgus that Ken
and I will be doing this upcoming Friday. But there are lots of presents
covering a wide range of retro topics:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_efz3edJt4Q?si=-SOdseciHVp10Y4w">https://www.youtube.com/live/_efz3edJt4Q?si=-SOdseciHVp10Y4w</a>

14) TheRetroChannel went into a deep dive talking about RGB and composite
video outputs and getting them working with SCART. Although not a Coco
specific video (he uses a Sega Master System in the video), the general
principles here should apply to the Coco 3:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/1gSMNLwl96Y?si=XX4swwyxZoW3zvyu">https://youtu.be/1gSMNLwl96Y?si=XX4swwyxZoW3zvyu</a>

15) Practical IT with Jeremy Leik on YouTube did their Sunday Night Retro
Talk, and he mentions that he started on a Coco - and then he brings
up Cloud9Tech (Mark Marlette) and RetroRewind (Frank) for RAM upgrades
(although the link was broke) and the CocoSDC, respectively:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QAngh_vaDUI?si=2eBpmdTxlO1EOTF3&t=151">https://www.youtube.com/live/QAngh_vaDUI?si=2eBpmdTxlO1EOTF3&t=151</a>

16) AnotherMaker posted a video about building a diagnostic cartridge
for the Coco 1,2 or 3 (note that it is the Tandy version 2.0 version,
so it doesn't check any of the things unique to the Coco 3):
  <a href="https://youtu.be/0L6OtoY7bHo?si=t_qPCWpnvOEZ9G9o">https://youtu.be/0L6OtoY7bHo?si=t_qPCWpnvOEZ9G9o</a>

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Dragon 32/64
</strong></big>------------
1) Julian Brown posted an update of his getting the PAL daughterboard
working although he is still missing the amplifier to get full proper
stable color). But he likes how clear the signal/text is now:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3693672364225739">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3693672364225739</a>/

2) Allan Macpherson posted the 6809 assembler source code for his high res
graphics screen text driver for the Dragon, which supports 32, 51 or 64
columns (x 24) for the Dragon 32 or 64 (It even has a 32x24 PMODE 3 color
text option). If I understand right, it also adds some commands to BASIC
to support the new text "modes":
  <a href="https://github.com/Abimelef/DragonTextXX">https://github.com/Abimelef/DragonTextXX</a>

3) Julian also posted a question on the Dragon Facebook group, about his
upcoming experimenters SuperBOB boards (for both Dragons & Coco's); he
is wondering if what people think the pros and cons are of providing both
male and female header pins for each node, or just rows of male header pins
(which is the prototype he currently has made). Please leave any comments
on his post:
