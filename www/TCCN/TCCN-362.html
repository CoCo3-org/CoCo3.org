Retro Computer Festival 2024: November 9-10, 2024
Centre for Computing History, Cambridge, England
In the early stages of planning for this year, this is (I believe) the
largest general retro computing show in the UK (it's their VCF style show),
covering all retro machines. NOTE: thanks to Randy Kindig, it is confirmed
that it is a 2 day show.

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">COCOFEST!
</strong></big>---------
1) A bit of confusion in that live streaming of the show floor was done
via The Coco Nation channels on Twitch and YouTube, but the seminars were
on the Glenside Color Computer Club's YouTube stream. We will make this
more clear (and in advance!) next year. But you can watch replays of all
4 seminars as well as the auction on the Glenside YouTube channel:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@glensideccc/streams">https://www.youtube.com/@glensideccc/streams</a>
And the show floor livestream on The Coco Nation channel:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The_CoCo_Nation/streams">https://www.youtube.com/@The_CoCo_Nation/streams</a>

2) Some summary videos are already popping up, to, including:
Bob Emery (La Coco Strangiato) (he actually has bit of our jam session too):
  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvywZMwFTS8?si=NKUEMJ0ZhtO4sX5i">https://youtu.be/KvywZMwFTS8?si=NKUEMJ0ZhtO4sX5i</a>
Obscu:RE (9B's channel) (even includes Coco multi-voice generated music
as a background):

3) There are also numerous groups of photos, from Glenside, Jim Brain,
Ron Delvaux, etc. on Facebook.
(I can find some if people on the show don't already have a ton. I will
show my Robert Kilgus signing the Dino Wars poster)


<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
</strong></big>-------------------------------
1) Coco Town released Game revolutions cycle 9 of his project of finishing
a Moon Patrol style game from his youth, this time investigating why the
scrolling speed in the previous episode started fluctuating:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/FO1SetsLCbQ?si=w_UA3zLeVkjfczLT">https://youtu.be/FO1SetsLCbQ?si=w_UA3zLeVkjfczLT</a>

2) While not a Coco related video, Taylor & Amy's latest episode (covering
an 8085 based homebrew computer - the same CPU as the Tandy Model 100/102)
did mention that they were sorry that they missed CocoFest, and to watch
The Coco Nation. Thanks for the shoutout!
  <a href="https://youtu.be/3qrhPROKYrU?si=5--CPfcCiCbBrvbL">https://youtu.be/3qrhPROKYrU?si=5--CPfcCiCbBrvbL</a>

3) Tim and AJ posted a time lapse video showing an entire recording day of
their Sibling Rivalry show, "behind the scenes". Since they record 4 shows in
a single day, they actually do costume and hair changes between each machine:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/iWcYIbtcYl0?si=xRFIE64pedHrQEpx">https://youtu.be/iWcYIbtcYl0?si=xRFIE64pedHrQEpx</a>

4) TRS-80 Retro Programing posted a video taking an in depth look using
the flashlight in his Tales of Suburbia game that he is getting close
to finishing:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/rEPSmnAIG84?si=qOqkIL3n7fNuJwP1">https://youtu.be/rEPSmnAIG84?si=qOqkIL3n7fNuJwP1</a>
He also did a video on random graphics, based on a listing in the BASIC
manuals, and includes some shortcuts for some graphics commands:

5) Henry Gernhardt posted a video (just before CocoFest, where he
demonstrated this live, as well as his FORTH ROM) about getting the latest
Fujinet hardware going (including assembly), and what he discovered along the
way. This is the version that is a cartridge and doesn't need separate power:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/5ZLF359y6DE?si=TaVZwZd1Yg8LsHCf">https://youtu.be/5ZLF359y6DE?si=TaVZwZd1Yg8LsHCf</a>

6) Alderson Retro Computing put up a short video on YouTube showing a
small demo program for the Coco 3, and showing how to type the code in
a text editor in Windows, and then copying/pasting the code into current
versions of VCC directly:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/D4eyEpaECNo?si=FriybMWa_5wi3klM">https://youtu.be/D4eyEpaECNo?si=FriybMWa_5wi3klM</a>

7) RetroAndGaming posted a video about upgrading a Coco CPU from the
Motorola 6809 to the Hitachi 6309, and using some tips from my comments
on his previous video to test color and and sound on his Coco 1:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/TRcOYjvvE_U?si=AgQzm3iS2wemLPXa">https://youtu.be/TRcOYjvvE_U?si=AgQzm3iS2wemLPXa</a>

8) Mike Kadolph posted on the Coco group on Facebook that after 5 months,
he has "completed my remake of my 1980's project and have a working 2
meter ham radio repeater, using his Coco 2:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161300032417641">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161300032417641</a>/

9) Thomas Cherryhomes is asking the Coco programming community for some
help in porting some cross platform turn based games, including Poker,
Yahtzee, trivia games, etc. to run with Fujinet, allowing players to play
against each other over the internet and across different 8 bit platforms
in the same game:

10) At the same time as CocoFest last weekend, Brazil was also having
their 13th RetroSC retro computing show, including their wide variety of
Coco clones, in Blumenau, SC, Brazil. Luciano Scharf put up some photos
from the show in the Coco group on Facebook:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161288870922641">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161288870922641</a>/

11) Rick Adams released a re-imagining of game he wrote decades ago
called Omnistar. Turns out he recently found a printed source listing of
his original (previously presumed lost) half completed version of the game,
and found that it was actually planned to be more expansive than the release
he did recently. So he and others are thinking of ways to try and OCR the
listing, and maybe complete the original vision of the game:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/colorcomputer/posts/960484908900575">https://www.facebook.com/groups/colorcomputer/posts/960484908900575</a>/

12) The TRS-80 Trash Talk podcast was live last Saturday during CocoFest
as well (and were asking if anybody could pop on from the Fest floor to do
a report - which I passed along on the previous weeks show and mentioned
again Saturday morning to a few people, but I don't think anybody had time
- I know I didn't. I haven't had time to watch the whole show to see if
there is any Coco related stuff in the episode yet, but I hope to pop on
their next episode to talk about the Fest:

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">MC-10
</strong></big>-----
1) Olipix on YouTube put up an almost hour video (in French) going through
the Alice (one can translate with close captioning) and it's history,
including the original agreements between Tandy and Matra. Also included
is deep dives into the hardware with all versions of the Alice. He also
includes some sample games for the various versions of the Alice:

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Dragon 32/64
</strong></big>------------
1) RoboNuggie on YouTube posted a video about his finding and experience
on revisiting the Dragon 32 of his youth via Ciaran Anscomb's XRoar on
his FreeBSD machine. He goes through the various menus in XRoar as well,
and then demos a few games:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/rnuf_bAeYh8?si=f2ME8k6ImVK1EwxW">https://youtu.be/rnuf_bAeYh8?si=f2ME8k6ImVK1EwxW</a>

2) Polish YouTube channel Tomasz Ogarnia posted a half hour video (in Polish,
but with no translate available, unfortunately) about his making a dual Atari
joystick adaptor for his Dragon 32, and then testing it with numerous games:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/KRxzFqrp1Sg?si=66aqqmwsJJBCsyYM">https://youtu.be/KRxzFqrp1Sg?si=66aqqmwsJJBCsyYM</a>

3) Julian Brown has posted many updates to his Dragon PAL daughterboard
design, and other things, to the point that I have been losing
track. Hopefully he is in the chat to give us a proper update!
Latest photo update:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3705951122997863">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3705951122997863</a>/
He is also working on a 4 slot multipak type product for the Dragon as well:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3705153339744308">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3705153339744308</a>/

4) Phil Harvey-Smith posted files for a redesigned top for a Gotek/Dragon
Drive, allowing the addition of a 0.96" 128x64 OLED display:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3702494710010171">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3702494710010171</a>/
And a picture of it installed and in action:

2) Tim and AJ played the game Climb (written by Andrew Pakerski for
Chromasette magnazine) on the latest episode of Sibling Rivalry. This is
one of my favourites by Andrew - with great sound effects and fun game play:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/VXmGaoVbogY?si=a3laCICWnYU3vxkA">https://youtu.be/VXmGaoVbogY?si=a3laCICWnYU3vxkA</a>

3) YouTube channel RetroGamerDiaries did a 45 minute video detailing

4) Erico Monteiro put up a gameplay video for his new semigraphics game

5) Jim Gerrie released Success Mansion for the MC-10, ported from the Coco
original by Paul Ruby Jr. in 1986, which actually used the SSP to speak
the game out loud:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/K0aFaqhu24E?si=NMGcww3mbeR37C0c">https://youtu.be/K0aFaqhu24E?si=NMGcww3mbeR37C0c</a>

8) Glen Dahlgren posted a newspaper article from way back where he and
another school student created a fantasy game... which was the inspiration
for his Coco 3 graphic adventure game "In Quest of the Star Lord" some
years later:
