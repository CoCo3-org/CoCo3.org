-------------------------------

He also put a video up about "weird Coco BASIC errors" (they are all
related to reserved BASIC keywords):
  https://youtu.be/YMTVdX-KZKc?si=sj9ODUTGIEzvoPhm

2) Coco Town on YouTube made an intro guide video to his channel. His
number of subscribers have taken off (1,84K at the time I checked just
before the show), so this is to benefit new people to his channel:
  https://youtu.be/NVqnFraNS5o?si=pecb5etzmzy4_ezd

3) George Janssen has lesson 4 up on his YouTube (GBJanssen 6809), as well

  https://youtu.be/GvfNK-nwvgc?si=QHJuqzNvFqEtXIYg

5) Simon Jonassen has another update to his online graphics editor - and
it appears that he is adding graphics primitives as part of it's toolbox,
rather than just drawing pixels. Here he shows a circle (not filled):

Dragon 32/64

PAL daughterboard - still a few things to work out, but it is giving a
great 2 color picture:

Game On news (all Coco related platforms):
==========================================
1) Jim Gerrie has ported "Magic Square" to the MC-10. Originally written by
James Coan in 1977 from his book "Advanced BASIC Applications and Problems":

He also released his MC-10 conversion of the Nostromo game that Allen
Murphy is working on (for the Coco), although Jim's is strictly low res and
text. Both ports are based on the original NEC PC-6001 version from Japan:

available. He also has a rather extensive blog entry about this game:
