Retro Computer Festival 2024: November 9-10, 2024
Centre for Computing History, Cambridge, England
In the early stages of planning for this year, this is (I believe) the
largest general retro computing show in the UK (it's their VCF style show),
covering all retro machines. NOTE: thanks to Randy Kindig, it is confirmed
that it is a 2 day show.

Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
-------------------------------
1) Today is our 365th episode - this means people new to the show can spend
an entire year watching a show EVERY DAY, occasionally up to 6 hours per day!

2) Jason (cocoman.biz) has put his video about CocoFest 2024 Day 2 on his
Fairly Amused YouTube page:
  https://youtu.be/rh62H48P4HI?si=difoDnb21tUoucch
Also, Jason has temporarily had to get a new domain for cocoman.biz:
  https://cocoman.my-online.store/

3) The 6502 Show did a video showing his using TSC's Adaptation Guide to
adapt Flex for the 6800 to his homebrew 6802 system... could this also be
ported to the 6803 in the MC-10?
  https://youtu.be/TJUeloqCTRA?si=ad4o91vKgSVkYxV7

4) Coco Town on YouTube returns to working on his Moon Patrol style game
with Game Revolutions cycle 11 - this time working on scrolling gravel at
high speed, based on a user suggestion:
  https://youtu.be/hWg3OAJuMhE?si=44FO-IrTgo6GRDVL

5) Neil Blanchard announce on Facebook that anyone who has their CocoFest
2024 pass, will be able to enter Tandy Assembly in September for *free*
(regular attendees; those with tables as exhibitors or vendors will still
pay their normal fees):
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161339084337641/

6) 8-Bit Wall of Doom on YouTube released a 20 minute video about the Foenix
F256 - with the FNX6809 and NitrOS9 Level 1 and 2 ports that Boisy made for
them. This talk covers some of the history of the 6809, OS-9 and NitrOS9:,
and shows the board and the FNX6809 part:
  https://youtu.be/R6Tcj2NeeRM?si=rbQ-OXoVjEDJbzsO

7) Thomas Cherryhomes has announced that the Coco's Fujinet firmware is
now part of the nightly builds, and can be applied via the web flasher app,
for those who want to try the bleeding edge of Fujinet on the Coco:
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161343997912641/

8) Simon Jonassen posted on the Coco Facebook group that thanks to a little
cable extender that John Whitworth had originally done for the SuperRGB
(to extend/move any VDG upgrades to away from the their original spot)
worked for the CocoVGA as well on his PAL T1 Coco 2. The PAL T1 Coco has
the VDG located under the keyboard, and there isn't enough space to plug
in the satellite boards for the CocoVGA or SuperRGB. This little upgrade
plugs into the VDG socket but puts out a cable that can than fit elsewhere
in the case with these taller upgrades:
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161337890112641/

9) For those who were not able to make it to the Fest, Brian Wieseler has
posted some photos of the Coco 1 pre-production board that he got from Robert
Kilgus (dates to probably spring of 1980 - before the official Coco release:
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/colorcomputer/posts/974392120843187/

10) Eddie Malphrus posted a photo of what the Coco exhibit he is working
on for VCF-SW (two weeks from now in Dallas/Fort Worth):
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/colorcomputer/posts/974114837537582/

11) Chris Burke (of B&B fame) posted, with a picture, a Searle style 6809
board that he converted to use a 6809E (external clock, like the Coco
uses). He hints that was doing some "6809E in-circuit emulation experiments
and didn't want to risk blowing up a Coco".... so what experiments is
doing for a Coco, I wonder?
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/6809assembly/posts/3380657868894238/

12) Tim Lindner has posted a browser based 6809 disassembler, which includes
the feature of following code execution, to help it differentiate data areas
from code areas. It is based on DASM09 originally by Arto Salmi. It allows
raw BIN code as well as DECB files (with the 5 byte pre & post -ambles):
  https://www.macmess.org/follow9.html

13) Tim Gilberts, one of our special guests on the giant 6 hour Dragon show
we did some time back, did a report the Portable Computer show that that
was at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge that were mentioning
the past couple of months, which you can watch on YouTube:

MC-10
-----
1) Jim Gerrie released an MC-10 program that shows 17 flags using the
MC-10's SG4 graphics (a few even have some brief songs):
  https://youtu.be/NVUlPWr8CCE?si=1xENrsDIf7shjH_H

2) Tim Halloran (a regular on the TRS-80 Trash Talkers podcast) posted a
video about the PiKey-10 for the MC-10 - a hardware addition that allows
using a modern keyboard on the MC-10 - while still leaving the original
keyboard usable as well:
  https://youtu.be/qATZ3tDIU1s?si=VYEHg_0rfimVqft2


Dragon 32/64
------------
1) Robcfg in the World of Dragon Forums posted up a picture of a fully
assembled Dragon Beta board (scroll down):
  https://archive.worldofdragon.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11044&start=30

2) There was a question to Jim Brain about software support for the MIDI
Maestro board for the Dragon. Ciaran Anscomb (author of XRoar, Dunjunz,
etc.) found some software originally written by Ian ones that might work
with the Dragon 64 serial port, and uploaded it the World of Dragon forum:
  https://archive.worldofdragon.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=11176

3) Julian Brown did numerous update posts on his Dragon ATX project. In one
of the latest ones he posted, he mentions that since he no longer has use
an actual 40 pin SAM but a CPLD with more pins, that he can add more RAM,
have a single byte to write to map video RAM (rather than the odd/even
memory addresses per bit), and also to extend the RAM that the VDG can
see up to 128K:
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3720917938167848/
Actually, just this morning, Julian sent me the full details thus far:
"Dragon RevX4 Plus Kitchen Sink Edition

ATX board is fab ready but still being checked.
SAMx VHDL is baselined for the current spec to
get the board up and running -

Current Spec:

Flex-ATX sized board to fit any regular mini-
or micro-ATX case, using the ATX power supply
Single speed CPU (with regular fast mode)
64K SRAM (out of 4MB fitted)
128K Video RAM address space
16K ROM (out of 512K fitted)
Plugin Video options
Plugin Audio options
4 MPI ports
Joystick and Cassette ports migrated to mini-din
Joysticks upgraded to 2 fire buttons
Serial RS232
Optional PS2 keyboard support

Target Spec (different from above):

Double/Quad speed CPU (smooth video fast modes)
1MB SRAM (out of 4MB fitted)*
2K page size for RAM, 2 tasks supported
128K Video RAM address space
16K ROM paged out of 512K**
Plugin Audio options***
Generic expansion port
(1 or 2 depending on main board size)

* If I can get the mapping to work at the 4MB size I
will. Maximum address space is 16MB. It may require a
larger CPLD to make this viable (plus the Xilinx chip
specified is no longer made). RAM page lookup will be
from memory although the current map will be held in
registers so only needs access while switching tasks

** ROM will paged at 8K boundaries and can be mapped
into any of the regular ROM base addresses. Finer
grained paging is possible and potentially to any
point in the 64k memory space (ignoring the last 2K).
I'm aiming to make the ROM writable from in-system
allowing for either a "ram drive" without batteries
or sideways ram. Writing of the flash rom is performed
by the SAM, not the CPU so this requires the
introduction of a blitter function

*** The 2nd, 3rd and 4th expansion slots have two PIA
blocks associated with each (selected from the PIA1
address space $ff20-$ff3f), and further mapped ram
bound to $40000, $80000 and $C0000 (all subject to
getting the ram paging working nicely)"


4) Steven Goodwin did another presentation of his "20 GOTO 10" book (we
talked to him about it a year or two ago). This presentation actually has
a fair about the Dragon 32 in it, including a tech description of how and
why the setting of the screen address (using the SAM and VDG) works the
way it does:
