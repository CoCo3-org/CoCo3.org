9) Henry (our special guest next week) released his next episode of The
Break Key on YouTube, which is part 2 of building his own ROM. This round

liked his visual representation of the keyboard matrix in his program,
showing the PIA):

Leany, one of the authors of the Novasoft / Tom Mix Software "Vegas Game
Pack" as well as the Coco 3 "Slots and Cards", passed away. We interviewed
him and his brother Doug in our "A pair of Coco Brother game developers"
episode on the old show, where Paul and Tim Thayer appeared with Doug and
Kevin Leany, helping interview each other about Coco game development:

4) Rutherford Le Blang posted a picture of him playing the Coco version of
Canyon Climber - on an RG353V running ArkOS (I think this is beta hardware?):
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161108199157641/

5) Matt Darr posted a video of the very first BASIC game he wrote while

7) Chronologically Gaming covered a cross platform Adventure game that
had a contest - Pimania - on the Dragon 32:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JElBJ6QwUoE&t=353s
In the same episode he covered a text adventure game by Rob Shaw (of Tut's
Tomb & Shock Trooper fame) called Raiders for the Dragon. As far as I know,
this one never made it to the Coco.
