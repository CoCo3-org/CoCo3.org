Mark Overholser hosts the news, and Sloopy hosts the Game On Challenge.

Mix Software).

for Sundog Systems, Doug Masten - and Glen Dahlgren who ran Sundog (and
who has been on the show several times before, including during our Dave
Dies interview) will be on to help co-interview Doug about one of the most
ambitious Coco 3 games done at that time (1991-1993)

out and were suddenly silenced ...

3) Paul Shoemaker : Hi everyone.  I just released a CoCo version of my
most recent game, Video Poker
https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10160737831767641/

4) Richard Kelly : "Maze Creator" version 0.10K.  This is my rewrite of
the maze-making algorithm.  I had to do so weird code tweaking to make the
PMODE graphics look right.  The thing is - does it look right on a real
CoCo 1/2/3?  I'll have to leave it to you folks to find out, as my current
CoCo isn't connected to anything right now.  Feel free to post bug reports!

5) David Mitchell : This is probably the type-in I messed around most
with back in the day. I used Rainbow Writer and a custom character set to
produce a High-res version. Good times..
