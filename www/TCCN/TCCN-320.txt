The Coco Nation News stories for Episode 320, July 8, 2023
===================================================================
Collected by L. Curtis Boyle

Surprise special guest today - Dan Barber is on to talk about his USB Coco
project, which includes his first video showing it in action!

August 12 we have Matt Harper on (developer of Wizard's Den sold by Tom
Mix Software).

August 19 we have a special treat - the original programmer of The Contras
for Sundog Systems, Doug Masten - and Glen Dahlgren who ran Sundog (and
who has been on the show several times before, including during our Dave
Dies interview) will be on to help co-interview Doug about one of the most
ambitious Coco 3 games done at that time (1991-1993)

September 9 we have Mark P. & Charlie from Portacoco.com. If you were
at the Fest, you would have seen them at their booth showing Coco's (and
monitors) running wirelessly together and off batteries that do NOT require
modifications to a Coco case to attach.

Frank of Retrorewind.ca let me know that the CocoSDC is now back in stock
and his recovery is going well, which will help him keep up with orders

things he has added to attic in his game in progress, Tales of Suburbia:

He also did a video of "Do It Yourself Program 18-2: Lightning storm", a
type in program from the Coco 2 Extended BASIC manual (page 211 if you are
interested), which uses some tricks like switch PMODE's without clearing
the screen in between:

2) Coco Town released a video to show going through all of the SAM/VDG
video modes, including a machine language program that lets you switch
between modes on the fly (and tells you which one you are about to view):
