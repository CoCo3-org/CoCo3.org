Retro-Computing Expo '24 is on June 22 from 11 am until 7 pm at Anvil Center

the Retro-Computing Expo and the Retro-Gaming Expo. They already several
presenters lined up, including 4 people to talk about the NABU, including
Leo Binkowski who was an engineer at NABU. George Philips, the author of
the TRS-80GP emulator and a regular on the TRS-80 Trash Talk podcast is
also presenting, amongst others. This is supported by the Chilliwack Retro
Computing Club, which has it's own Facebook Group:

Retro Computer Festival 2024: November 9-10, 2024
Centre for Computing History, Cambridge, England
In the early stages of planning for this year, this is (I believe) the
largest general retro computing show in the UK (it's their VCF style show),
covering all retro machines. NOTE: thanks to Randy Kindig, it is confirmed
that it is a 2 day show.

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
</strong></big>-------------------------------
1) Coco Town put up a different kind of video - How a warning message in
Color BASIC "breaks the rules" and frightened him when he was 10:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/xDHwzg3lvO0?si=kSBYC24cGzNe0OZc">https://youtu.be/xDHwzg3lvO0?si=kSBYC24cGzNe0OZc</a>

2) RetroAndGaming on YouTube did a short summer holiday special video,
recapping what his channel has done recently (including his Coco 1) and
that he is taking a break from retro stuff for the summer... but when he
gets back to it, he plans on working on the Coco again:

3) Thomas Cherryhomes has another Coco related update that he posted about
in both the Coco Discord and the Coco Facebook group, adding Becker port
support to Fujinet PC, which allows hooking up to Fujinet from any Coco
emulator that supports the port (and includes a video):

Color Rio Club meeting (which was held on June 1) in Brazil:

Jason also attended Hamvention 2024 in Xenia, Ohio, and his two part
coverage can be found on his Fairly Amused YouTube channel. No Coco finds

6) Our very own Ken Waters posted a photo of a couple of musical legend
celebrities who got their picture in front of the Dino Wars posted:
pianist Todd Hunter (who plays with Dionne Warwick) and Antonia Bennett,
daughter of Tony Bennett and a famous jazz singer in her own right:

7) Tim Lindner posted a link to a YouTube video where Usagi Electric (David)
has started a new experimental series with longer episodes interviews AJ
of Forgotten Machines (whom a lot of us saw at CocoFest last month). One
of the topics that comes up - the flashing "eye" on KITT from the TV series
Knight Rider originally used a 6809 to control it (6:44):

8) Henry of The Break Key (and our panel) released a video on his YouTube
channel with an update to his ROM Forth project - adding in error messages
(and scrolling):

9) Pierre Sarrazin posted an update and question for the public who use
his CMOC C-compiler on the Coco, to the cocolist email group:
"Hi. I'm in the process of adding a second calling convention to CMOC,
a C-like compiler that targets the 6809.
I have seen C programs for the 6809 that had some code written in
assembly that assumed a calling convention where the first parameter
of a function is received in register B or X, depending on its size,
instead of on the stack, as in CMOC's default convention.
platotermCoCo is such a program:
<a href="https://github.com/beretta42/platotermCoCo/tree/master/src/coco2">https://github.com/beretta42/platotermCoCo/tree/master/src/coco2</a>
I'm looking for a detailed description of that calling convention,
with the goal of clarifying a few questions that I have on corner cases.
1. Is the first parameter still passed in B or X when the parameter is
  a 1- or 2-byte struct or union?
2. When the return value is one or two bytes, which register is it
  returned in?
3. When the function must return a struct, a union, a long, a float
  or a double, does it receive a hidden first parameter that points
  to the location to be filled with the return value?
  If so, is that hidden parameter received in X?
  What if the return type is a 1- or 2-byte struct or union?
Thanks for any leads..."

10) "Leep" on the Coco Discord is working on a massive multi-level, 8 way
scrolling graphic arcade game for the Coco 3. He needs some people to test
the graphics engine, with high system requirements:
Coco 3, 2 MB RAM, 6309. Both 1986 and 1987 versions of the GIME. This
is to ensure that the precise timing of switching the GIME mode from
320x200x16 color to hardware text is timed properly to look smooth. He
has some details in his post in the "hardware general" channel on the Coco
Discord, and a link to download and try it:

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">MC-10
</strong></big>-----
1) Jim Gerrie released an update to his "Texted" text editing utility
for the MC-10. This one runs in SG6 (64x48x4) and supports lower case
characters, with a 16x7 editing screen:

He also released "Robot Maze Learner", originally by Richard Forsyth and
Chris Naylor for the IBM PC in 1986, which was written to demonstrate
simple AI machine learning techniques:

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Dragon 32/64
</strong></big>------------
1) Italian YouTube channel "Thousand and One Adventure" did a 1/2 hour
video about ugBASIC, and includes compiling/running the same "random dots"
program on multiple platforms, including the Dragon 32. Turn CC on to get
the translated close caption text:

2) Phil Harvey-Smith posted a teaser of a replacement, 3D printed case
bottom for a Dragon (sounds like it needs a larger than average 3D printer
to do it as a one piece):
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3725214617738180">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3725214617738180</a>/

3) Julian Brown posted an update on his SAM rewrite for the RevX4 board,
where he mentions he may need a bigger CPLD to include all the features
that he wants to add (I will read post for full details):
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3723708431222132">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3723708431222132</a>/
He posted this morning that he is going for a bigger chip with possibly a
Spartan-6 FPGA being his choice, with some more details on what he wants
built in:

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Game On news (all Coco related platforms):
</strong></big>==========================================
1) Olipix, a French channel on YouTube, put up a video of their pick of
the top 30 games for the MC-10 and Alice 4K:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/YhLn5F0Am_g?si=gWanlGMhyxjyuazA">https://youtu.be/YhLn5F0Am_g?si=gWanlGMhyxjyuazA</a>

2) Jim Gerrie updated his 2010 game Snakebite for the MC-10 (originally
inspired by a Sinclair ZX-81 game). This version adds new key input methods
from Greg Dionne (creator the MC-10 BASIC compiler), the ability earn
extra lives and some other minor updates:

3) Spanish YouTube channel XperTek released a longer game play video this
week - "80's Games Volume 3", featuring 12 Coco 1/2 games that he plays
on his amber monitor equipped Coco 2, and includes both Tandy and 3rd
party released titles. Some of these he hasn't played in quite awhile,
and remembers how to play them on the fly:
