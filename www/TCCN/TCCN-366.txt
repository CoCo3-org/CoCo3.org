covering all retro machines. NOTE: thanks to Randy Kindig, it is confirmed
that it is a 2 day show.

Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
-------------------------------
1) Coco Town put up a different kind of video - How a warning message in
Color BASIC "breaks the rules" and frightened him when he was 10:
  https://youtu.be/xDHwzg3lvO0?si=kSBYC24cGzNe0OZc

2) RetroAndGaming on YouTube did a short summer holiday special video,
recapping what his channel has done recently (including his Coco 1) and
that he is taking a break from retro stuff for the summer... but when he
gets back to it, he plans on working on the Coco again:
  https://youtu.be/7B9oXfYXz3U?si=2pGBLbzmY5PBAld2

3) Thomas Cherryhomes has another Coco related update that he posted about
in both the Coco Discord and the Coco Facebook group, adding Becker port
support to Fujinet PC, which allows hooking up to Fujinet from any Coco
emulator that supports the port (and includes a video):

7) Tim Lindner posted a link to a YouTube video where Usagi Electric (David)
has started a new experimental series with longer episodes interviews AJ
of Forgotten Machines (whom a lot of us saw at CocoFest last month). One
of the topics that comes up - the flashing "eye" on KITT from the TV series
Knight Rider originally used a 6809 to control it (6:44):

channel with an update to his ROM Forth project - adding in error messages
(and scrolling):
  https://youtu.be/WDoWlSgZ3F8?si=VPXAZsrSg1UcHh0y

9) Pierre Sarrazin posted an update and question for the public who use
his CMOC C-compiler on the Coco, to the cocolist email group:
"Hi. I'm in the process of adding a second calling convention to CMOC,
a C-like compiler that targets the 6809.
I have seen C programs for the 6809 that had some code written in
assembly that assumed a calling convention where the first parameter
of a function is received in register B or X, depending on its size,
instead of on the stack, as in CMOC's default convention.
platotermCoCo is such a program:
https://github.com/beretta42/platotermCoCo/tree/master/src/coco2
I'm looking for a detailed description of that calling convention,
with the goal of clarifying a few questions that I have on corner cases.
1. Is the first parameter still passed in B or X when the parameter is
  a 1- or 2-byte struct or union?
2. When the return value is one or two bytes, which register is it
  returned in?
3. When the function must return a struct, a union, a long, a float
  or a double, does it receive a hidden first parameter that points
  to the location to be filled with the return value?
  If so, is that hidden parameter received in X?
  What if the return type is a 1- or 2-byte struct or union?
Thanks for any leads..."

10) "Leep" on the Coco Discord is working on a massive multi-level, 8 way
scrolling graphic arcade game for the Coco 3. He needs some people to test
the graphics engine, with high system requirements:
Coco 3, 2 MB RAM, 6309. Both 1986 and 1987 versions of the GIME. This
is to ensure that the precise timing of switching the GIME mode from
320x200x16 color to hardware text is timed properly to look smooth. He
has some details in his post in the "hardware general" channel on the Coco
Discord, and a link to download and try it:

MC-10
-----
1) Jim Gerrie released an update to his "Texted" text editing utility
for the MC-10. This one runs in SG6 (64x48x4) and supports lower case
characters, with a 16x7 editing screen:
  https://youtu.be/IWHtO05TYCI?si=DZ6GZJv4_z1U82cO
He also released "Robot Maze Learner", originally by Richard Forsyth and
Chris Naylor for the IBM PC in 1986, which was written to demonstrate
simple AI machine learning techniques:

Dragon 32/64
------------
1) Italian YouTube channel "Thousand and One Adventure" did a 1/2 hour
video about ugBASIC, and includes compiling/running the same "random dots"
program on multiple platforms, including the Dragon 32. Turn CC on to get
the translated close caption text:
  https://youtu.be/SXIlrrj7u0Q?si=HGq4rXBh8d9bHtqo

2) Phil Harvey-Smith posted a teaser of a replacement, 3D printed case
bottom for a Dragon (sounds like it needs a larger than average 3D printer
to do it as a one piece):
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3725214617738180/

3) Julian Brown posted an update on his SAM rewrite for the RevX4 board,
where he mentions he may need a bigger CPLD to include all the features
that he wants to add (I will read post for full details):
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3723708431222132/
He posted this morning that he is going for a bigger chip with possibly a
Spartan-6 FPGA being his choice, with some more details on what he wants
built in:

Game On news (all Coco related platforms):
==========================================

2) Jim Gerrie updated his 2010 game Snakebite for the MC-10 (originally
inspired by a Sinclair ZX-81 game). This version adds new key input methods
from Greg Dionne (creator the MC-10 BASIC compiler), the ability earn
extra lives and some other minor updates:
  https://youtu.be/6vxURN9NKHo?si=vLznE7hHPrIzgiyI

3) Spanish YouTube channel XperTek released a longer game play video this
week - "80's Games Volume 3", featuring 12 Coco 1/2 games that he plays
on his amber monitor equipped Coco 2, and includes both Tandy and 3rd
party released titles. Some of these he hasn't played in quite awhile,
and remembers how to play them on the fly:
