machines. The main hall is already sold out for tables, and as of March 6,

speakers this year.

Retro-Computing Expo '24 is from 11 am until 7 pm at Anvil Center in New
Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. It is actually 2 shows in one:
the Retro-Computing Expo and the Retro-Gaming Expo. They already several
presenters lined up, including 4 people to talk about the NABU, including
Leo Binkowski who was an engineer at NABU. George Philips, the author of
the TRS-80GP emulator and a regular on the TRS-80 Trash Talk podcast is
also presenting, amongst others. This is supported by the Chilliwack Retro
Computing Club, which has it's own Facebook Group:
  (show the copy of the "poster" that I was sent from my local desktop -
  "Retro-Computing_Expo_24.jpg").

VCF-West looks to be happening August 2-3 (Fri-Sat) at the Computer History
Museum in Mountain View, California. This year they are a full partner with
the museum, so that admission for both the museum and VCF can be done with
one purchase, and the are taking people booking to be speakers/presenters
now as well.

IL. Sept 7-8, 2024 (Sept 6 evening (Friday) is reserved for vendors, etc
to set up). Unfortunately, their original block of rooms already sold out
in 3 hours after they announced yesterday. VCF is working with the hotel
to get more, but that won't happen until Monday)

Retro Computer Festival 2024: November 9-10, 2024
Centre for Computing History, Cambridge, England
In the early stages of planning for this year, this is (I believe) the
largest general retro computing show in the UK (it's their VCF style show),
covering all retro machines. I am not sure if it 1 or 2 days; the header &
ordering part of the site says November 9th only, but just below that it
says November 9-10.

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Coco 1/2/3 (and multi-platform)
</strong></big>-------------------------------
1) Tim Lindner has posted some "lightly" commented 6809 assembly source
code from the Diecom game Iron Forest, to show a routine that works with
the Diecom designed Master system Phaser interface:
  <a href="https://github.com/tlindner/DCLG-Kernel">https://github.com/tlindner/DCLG-Kernel</a>

2) CocoTown has posted his next video about upgrading his Moon Patrol
style game from when he was a teenager with Game revolutions cycle 7 -
this time optimizing the players car not just for speed, but to enhance
it's appearance:

3) Eddie Malphrus, in the "All Things Tandy/Radio Shack" group on Facebook,
posted a brief history of Videotex from the original Project Green Thumb
up to the Videotex cartridge on the Coco. It includes photos of the
original TRS-80 Model 1 shell based version that we showed a few weeks
ago, the Agvision version, and the Professional Farmers version as well
(go through photos):

4) Thomas Cherryhomes released another Coco Fujinet video, this time
showing the News Reader:

He also did a quick video showing NDIR (Network Directory) as well:

He also shared some pics from VCF-East, where he taught classes on Fujinet,
and mentioned that there has been an attitude shift towards Fujinet and
that people are starting to volunteer to help:

5) The Stray Pointers podcast interviewed our Glenside president Jim Brain
in their Season 2, episode 10 show, covering his journey in electronics,
Commodore computers, the Coco and his company Retro Innovations:

6) Congrats to David Kroeker who sold out all 4 Diecom adapters/phaser
guns by the end of the weekend. He will be doing a second run later,
and then possibly pass it off to someone else to continue manufacturing them.

7) Evie Solomon's presentation from VCF-Socal earlier this year is now
up on YouTube, where she goes through the Backbit and what machines and
features it supports. Including going through the Coco, 6809 and even
mentioning the 6309:

8) TRS-80 Retro Programing did a video showing his fixing of bugs of his
save game feature in his Tales of Suburbia game, which is nearing completion:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/__TiYtPLDcc?si=pJzqGSmvcfpm8GCR">https://youtu.be/__TiYtPLDcc?si=pJzqGSmvcfpm8GCR</a>


<big><strong style="color:lightblue">MC-10
</strong></big>-----
1) Canadian Retro Things did a video of his upgrading his MC-10 (already
modded with 8K RAM on the main board) to composite video output, using
the upgrade from Ed Snider @ zippsterzone.com:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/li6n4wqevmc?si=faY4urt_4LuyEPm6">https://youtu.be/li6n4wqevmc?si=faY4urt_4LuyEPm6</a>


<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Dragon 32/64
</strong></big>------------
1) Bosco released (on the world of dragons forums) a set of (mostly)
classic heavy metal style song clips based on the Dragon, it's hardware
(6809) and software (Microdeal & their mascot, Cuthbert). Tomfoolery /
work in Progress is what he calls them (I quite like them, being a bit of
a classic metalhead myself):

(play a sample or two from folder on my desktop)

2) RetroGingerPod on YouTube did a 3 part (so far) video series from a
wrapped in black plastic mystery computer to exploring a quite yellowed
(and water damaged) Dragon 32:
Discovery (and shows how bad of a state the power supply board is in):

3) Mostly Horses and Retro Computing on YouTube did a video of attempting
to load tapes on a Dragon 32. I am not sure what his exact set up is,
but the audio did sound like a proper Dragon (or Coco) tape, but it wasn't
picking it up at all. Cable issue maybe?:

4) Julian Brown found some more corrections to do with his PAL daughterboard
(part of his Dragon replacement motherboard project), but he is not fully
where he wants to be yet:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3690291057897203">https://www.facebook.com/groups/dragon32/posts/3690291057897203</a>/

5) Richard Harding posted a link on the Dragon Facebook group to the
text of an interview that Helen Osborne did with David Farrugia, who ran
"Dragon Computers and Software" shop during the Dragons heyday, on the
island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea.

<big><strong style="color:lightblue">Game On news (all Coco related platforms):
</strong></big>==========================================
1) Pere Serrat has now released AGD Games pack #12 for the SuperSprite FM+
board (for both Coco and Dragon). This is the upgrade board with improved
graphics, hardware sprites and a sound chip. This pack adds 4 more games
that use the enhanced features:
Castle of Sorrow
Droid Buster
Flype v2.0
Space Escape

2) Erico Patricio Monteiro has a new animated gif showing his progress
on the low res action game The Savage Sword of Cocon. The final game is
written in ugBASIC, I believe:
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161264342347641">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359462640/posts/10161264342347641</a>/
He also shot (with a camera aimed at a TV) video of the game in action
as well. While not as clean looking, it does show some of the animation
effects better:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Pl6S_sYqnI?si=AmBfZ3xHGvGe9ltq">https://youtu.be/8Pl6S_sYqnI?si=AmBfZ3xHGvGe9ltq</a>

3) Retro Trailer-2 on YouTube put up a gameplay video of a recent Game On
Challenge - Time Fighter by Mark Data Products, including getting to the
second time period:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/1NFoFhnyEhE?si=cK4uuSMwC5cs1aS7">https://youtu.be/1NFoFhnyEhE?si=cK4uuSMwC5cs1aS7</a>

4) Jim Gerrie ported a text adventure game called Enchanted Island,
originally written by 13 year old Greg Hassett on the TRS-80 Model 1/3 to
the MC-10, adding an animated title screen:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/LGjuP3FDEos?si=vF-wtG3A9gXhLoXF">https://youtu.be/LGjuP3FDEos?si=vF-wtG3A9gXhLoXF</a>
And another from the same author, Voyage to Atlantis was updated with some
bug fixes:

5) This weeks Sibling Rivalry with Tim & AJ features the game Vultures
on the Coco (originally from the Dragon). And Tim & AJ might have figured
out why AJ's luck playing games has been poorer than it should be:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/WbMIVgPOL1Y?si=Wl3pF3C0s_kpl8b1">https://youtu.be/WbMIVgPOL1Y?si=Wl3pF3C0s_kpl8b1</a>

6) Retrobloke on YouTube did a YouTube short showing the original box &
tape for MicroDeal's Space Fighter (a Star Trek clone):
