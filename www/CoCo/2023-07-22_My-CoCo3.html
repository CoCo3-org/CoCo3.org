			<p>7/22/2023 10:00 PM: -- <strong>My New CoCo!</strong></p>

			<p>I bought a CoCo3 off eBay recently!!</p>

			<div>

					<img style="margin:5px; float:right;" src="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6151-Medium.JPG" alt="" />
				</a>
				<p>Cosmetically it is in great, near mint, condition.  No yellowing. No scuff marks, gouges or wear marks.  So I'm guessing this CoCo saw very little use and was stored away for a good portion of it's years.  </p>
				<p>I got a good deal on it... approximately $275 including shipping.  These days, anything under $300 for a CoCo3 I consider a good deal.</p>
			</div>

			<div style="clear:both;">
				<a href="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6147.JPG">
					<img style="margin:5px; float:left;" src="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6147-Medium.JPG" alt="" />
				</a>
				<p>As shipped to me, the video was not working properly when I turned it on. I give credit to the seller for mentioning that the video had intermittent problems in the eBay listing.  I figured that either the GIME chip or the RAM just simply needed to be re-seated due to oxidation.  I also just thought that whatever it was, it could be fixed.   </p>

			<div style="clear:both;">
				<a href="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6319.JPG">
					<img style="margin:5px; float:right;" src="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6319-Medium.JPG"  alt="" />
				</a>
				<p>I opened up the computer to see if I could fix the video problem.  The inside was in great shape w/ very little dust.  I do not have a PLCC chip puller so I just barely lifted the two edges of the GIME chip with a small screwdriver, being *VERY* careful not to break the chip.  Not sure it actually moved but I did hear a slight popping sound when lifting up on it. And then I pushed back down it it to make sure it is well seated. Again, I am not sure it actually moved.  </p>

			<div style="clear:both;">
				<a href="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6324.JPG">
					<img style="margin:5px; float:left;" src="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6324-Medium.JPG"  alt="" />
				</a>
				<p>Then I pulled out the 4 RAM chips and I used a rubber eraser to clean the pins.  I put them back it, closed up the computer.</p>
			</div>

				<a href="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6341.JPG">
					<img style="margin:5px; float:right;" src="images/My-CoCo3/IMG_6341-Medium.JPG" />
				</a>
				<p>I plugged it in and turned it on and *BAM* it worked.  I could turn it off and on, hit the reset, and it is working fine now.  It has continued to work just fine w/ no hint of an intermittent issue. So... success!!</p>
